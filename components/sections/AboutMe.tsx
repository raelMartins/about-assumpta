          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Assumpta ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a Product Manager who loves turning ideas into real solutions
            that make life easier for people. My role is all about connecting
            the dots between users, design, and technology. I spend my time
            understanding what people need, working with designers to shape
            great experiences, and collaborating with engineers to bring
            products to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of it, I make sure that the products I work on are
            useful, easy to use, and aligned with both user needs and business
            goals. Think of me as the bridge that brings together big ideas and
            the practical steps to make them happen.
