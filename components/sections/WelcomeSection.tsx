      <p>
        I&apos;m a Product Manager, meaning I am in charge of developing and
        managing the life cycle of a product, usually from conception till
        completion, through market research, prioritization, product development
        and execution. The goal is always to deliver a product that not only
        meets user needs but also achieves company set objectives and creates
        value wherever I work.
